# Architecture Decision Records

This folder contains records of significant technical and design decisions.

## Purpose

When making choices that will affect future development, document the decision here. This helps:

- Remember why something was done a particular way
- Avoid revisiting the same decision repeatedly
- Onboard future collaborators (human or AI)

## Naming Convention

Use sequential numbering with short descriptions:
- `001-static-html-no-framework.md`
- `002-css-custom-properties.md`

## Template

```markdown
# ADR-[number]: [Title]

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Status:** Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-XXX

## Context

[What prompted this decision? What problem were we solving?]

## Decision

[What was decided?]

## Consequences

### Positive
- [Benefit 1]
- [Benefit 2]

### Negative
- [Trade-off 1]
- [Trade-off 2]

### Neutral
- [Implication that is neither good nor bad]

## Alternatives Considered

1. **[Alternative 1]:** [Why rejected]
2. **[Alternative 2]:** [Why rejected]
```
